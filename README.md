# ChocolateARM
Bare bones ARM1176 (ARMv6) emulator written in C#

This is an ARMv6 emulator written in C#, with emulation of some parts of the Raspberry Pi hardware. The CPU was not well tested and probably still contains a lot of bugs. Only a very small portion of the Raspberry Pi hardware was implemented, so it can't run many stuff. Some of the "bare metal" RasPi demos does work. Speed is awfully slow as expected.
You're free to improve or modify any portion of the code, but please give me the credits for what I wrote. Thanks :)
